              <p id="section">Stereotype Threat</p>
              <p class="indent">Up until now, I feel like I have been very fortunate. The schools I attended had a majority of asians and the career path I <em>was</em> on consisted mostly of women. Of course I've still dealt with the occassional idiots who would look at my test scores and scoff, "yeah 'cause you're asian" and dismiss my hardwork; or when I 'underperformed' I'd get some slighted comment like, "Really? I thought asians were suppose to be smart." But otherwise, it was rare for me to ever be looked down upon because of my race. Instead, the bar of expectations was higher for me than other people in my grade. As stereotype goes, it's definitely not the worst, but I really don't need my race to define who I am. I am me; which is defined by my actions and my thoughts.</p>
              <p class="indent">It wasn't until I was in high school that I realized how others viewed my gender as limiting. I still remember to this day, I had a family friend call me. She had asked me what I was planning on doing with my life/college major and I wasn't sure at the time. She then went on a tangent telling me to avoid becoming an engineer, because as women, we can't handle it. (Yes, this family friend is a woman. A woman discouraging another woman..for being a woman.) Claiming it to be too difficult a field for women and that the hours were grueling. I'm sure the latter is true, but the former really pissed me off. So there I was minding my own business after school and <em>this lady</em> calls and tells <strong>me</strong> that I shouldn't ever bother trying engineering because I'm a woman.</p>
              <p class="indent">And let's not forget the lovely fact that for some companies, women are paid less (as mentioned in my previous <a href="c4-tech-issues.html">article</a>). But that's not the only issue, men are more likely to get hired in general and one of the reasonings behind that is simply because women can have children. Why would a company "invest" in a woman, if she's only going to get pregnant, take a few months off (or maybe just plan to stay at home after only putting in a few years worth of work)? I have less of a chance of being hired just because I have the capability of starting a family? That's just messed up...</p>
              <p class="indent">Of course all of this is quite infuriating. Life is hard enough as it is; and to have people judge us on things we just can't change? Well, I just hope that when I'm out there looking for a job, I find a boss who isn't going to hold such things against me and just make me accountable for my work.</p>
