              <p id="date">11/6/2014 :: Phase 0 Week 8</p>
              <p class="indent">Boy does time fly. It's already the 8th week and in <em>less than two weeks</em> I'll be embarking on the 'bootcamp' part of my Dev BootCamp journey. And I'm scared. Excited. Worried. Anxious. Scared. (Oh wait, did I say that already?) There's a lot of uncertainty in this world, and I guess I just have to embrace it and have a little faith in myself.</p>
              <p id="section">What is "Ruby on Rails"?</p>
              <p class="indent">You see and hear this a lot once you've entered the coding world. You'll see job descriptions specifically seeking out "RoR developer" and coding on "Rails." <em>But what is it?</em> Of course by now you know that Ruby is a programming language. And with each language they have their own <em>personalities</em>. And maybe you've heard this quote by Bill Gates:</p>

              <p style="background-color: #429997; padding: 5px">"I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it." </p>
              <p class="indent"> Why does this apply to programming? Because that means these "lazy people" are most likely to be the ones who will find a solution that is the quickest and simplest. Code that is <span style="color: #F55C86">D.R.Y.</span> (Don't Repeat Yourself). And it's based off of this mentality that Rails was born. Rails is a framework created to assist the programmer in coding better and faster. It's a framework that is instilled with the ideal that you don't need repetitive code and is preprogrammed with the specific personality/style of ruby coding.</p>
              <p class="indent">I think I'll have more to share with you on this once I'm <em>actually</em> using this framework, but for now this is just a general definition of what Rails is. So that's all folks for this time. See you all in the next post!</p>
