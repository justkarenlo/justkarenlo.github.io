              <p id="date">11/17/2014 :: Phase 1 Week 1</p>
              <p class="indent">Holy Crap. Today was an explosion of crazy new wonderment. I'm sitting here on my train ride back writing this post and my mind is still reeling from the events of today. I have so many things rushing through my mind. All the new names and faces, the amount of support that DBC creates as a culture, the constant reminder that what we're doing here (expecting to learn so much stuff in the span of 9 weeks) is just straight-up CRAZY, oh and of course dealing with challenges as per normal. I guess the best way to organize my thoughts for the day is to well, actually organize them.</p>
              <p class="minorsection">Last Night, this morning, and introductions</p>
              <p class="indent">It is safe to assume that I didn't get much sleep. The anxiety of not being good enough, that I'll revert back to my awkward old quiet self (I will never tell you that I enjoyed high school or even much of college), that I'll be intimidated by the brilliant minds and allow myself to let that diminish my own progress, that maybe this is all just a hoax or a dream or just not reality that I'm chasing. So anxious, I was ready to throw up at one point (though it might also have to do with my bodily aversion to waking up at 5:45am for the first time in months). Getting off the CalTrain and walking to DBC, I finally felt myself quiet down. The constant hum of anxiety throughout the night finally dissipated and I was left with the calm that I can only assume comes from an accidental walking meditation. The next few moments seem to have just exploded. The morning, to sum up in a few words, was packed with: energy, excitement, shouts, laughter, awkward icebreakers, and small talk. And it was all great. I don't think I've ever been on a high for so long (literally felt like all day). On a side note: I'm so glad they provided food too, 'cause the thought of fending for myself on that first day would have just been too much for me to handle.</p>
              <p class="minorsection">Decisions</p>
              <p class="indent">I guess I didn't need as much organizing as I thought. The only thing that popped up as being an issue is commuting. I knew I was making a sacrifice commuting about 1.5-2 hours each way every day (that's almost 4 hours/day BAH). And I didn't think it would impact my decision making at DBC, but today it did. I could have stayed after for a coaching session at 7pm. And because of the train schedule after rush hour, I was pretty much looking at getting home well past 10pm with maybe a half an hour of waiting for the train. And when I made this realization, I knew I'd rather spend my first night NOT commuting that late and just work from home. And also made the realization that I will always be making the decision everyday about whether or not I wanted to stay late. As long as I put in the equal effort at home as I do at DBC I don't think it'll make much of a difference, but it definitely means I can't slip. I have to constantly urge myself to live and breathe code and I'll learn to make that second nature (right??????). Alright, I think at this point I've run out of juice to talk straight and should probably just rest my eyes, before I grab a quick dinner and get back to work; oh yeah and some sleep too.</p>
