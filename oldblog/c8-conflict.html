          <h4 id="theone">The one with the mother/daughter conflict</h4>
              <br>

              <p id="section">conflict</p>
              <p class="indent">It goes without saying (but I'm going to say it anyways) that 100% of us have gone through some ordeal or another in our lives. In fact, many ordeals. Conflict of needs, conflict of communication, conflict of simple or complicated misunderstandings. Conflict. Look at that word enough times and it won't look like a word anymore (and if you don't feel it yet, that means you haven't looked at it long enough). And we can avoid this conversation altogether. But no, I must continue. Conflict is what we go through every day of our lives, but reflecting on those past conflicts is how we learn.</p>
              <p class="indent">I think the single biggest conflict in my life was actually a series of little conflicts added together. It was the mother-daughter conflict. I tell ya during my teenage years we had dozens.. dozens... of fights. All over stupid things. And it wasn't until I moved out that I realized how I approached the situation incorrectly.</p>
              <p class="indent">I can't say for sure exactly which one of the arguments I want to point out; they seem to have blurred together over the years. But I do remember in essence how I felt. A majority of the time, it was an issue with control. My mom viewed something a certain way, and I would think differently. As a teenager, I was young, but admittedly, I was (actually, maybe still <em>am</em>...) headstrong. And frankly, some of those fights, there really wasn't a particular reason. Just something small would set off one of us and our equally stubborn nature escalated our "conversations." Overall, these conflicts would conclude via me putting in earbuds and blasting music to drown out my mother's yelling, locking myself up in my room, or even on occasion running to my car, driving off, and taking a walk around Target to cool down.</p>
              <p class="indent">Honestly, walking around Target was 100% guaranteed to help me feel better. I'm not saying that running away from your problems or conflicts is a good option, but there is a time when you know that if you stay any longer in the conflict, things will only get worse. Because by that point, your blood is boiling with anger and you're no longer thinking straight. And most likely with this mental 'handicap', you'll say or do things much worse than you'd like.</p>
              <p class="indent">If I could go back, I can't honestly say that I could convince my teenage self to do anything differently. I can wish it. But based on the fact that my mother and I are quite similar in our stubborn and prideful personalities, and the fact that these conflicts were quite random in nature, the likelihood of either of us backing down was slim to none. On one hand, you have a mother who doesn't understand the American culture (doesn't <em>want</em> to understand it) and believes she knows what's best for her daughter, and on the other, you have a <em>teenage</em> daughter trying to find her independence, her voice in the world. I know that's not an excuse for the way I acted I just believe fervently that we always have 20/20 vision in hindsight. But the fact of the matter is, I can only take these experiences moving forward, learn from them, and understand them. </p>
              <p class="indent">After I moved out and was able to displace myself from those past conflicts and analyze them. I realized that under all that anger, was just miscommunication and the frustration that went along with it. My mother was better with Chinese and I was better with English. We could talk ourselves in circles all day, but the other wouldn't understand (and I guess we figured yelling would help with the "listening"). But ultimately, all we needed was a little more patience. Now when I talk to my mom, I think she realizes more and more that I really have become a responsible adult. And more and more I realize that she does hear me, just sometimes misinterprets what I say. So we now take the extra time to interpret what we <em>mean</em> to say. We've both come to an understanding, patience, and respect for each other. So I guess you could say those past conflicts were just 'growing pains,' bad ones. </p>
              <p class="indent">There's a lot of honesty going on in this article, and I'm quite embarrassed to be sharing this with the world, but I'm pretty sure most mother/daughter (or even father/son) relationships get rocky at one time or another (especially during puberty) and so whoever is reading this either shares in my experiences or will share them when they have a daughter or son of their own. So lesson of the day? <span style="color: #CC6AB6">Don't just hear; listen.</span> </p>
