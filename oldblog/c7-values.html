              <p id="section">fair</p>
              <p class="indent">What does it mean to be fair? I'm definitely not talking about "mirror, mirror, on the wall who is the fairest of them all." I'm talking about justice, honesty, respect and being trustworthy. This is what I strive for everyday in life. Working on a team on the job or in school, <strong>being fair</strong>, that's important to me. Everyone does their share, their part, and this boat won't sink. If someone doesn't do their part, I'll hold them accountable. If I somehow slip, I hold myself accountable. It's not just about 'getting it done,' it's about getting it done <strong>right</strong>. And that's what I take most pride in, my fairness. I believe everyone should hold these standards because everyone is counting on everyone else. </p>
              <p class="indent">That's why I remember I had a friend ask me what she should do when it came time for a group project and none of her partners were contributing or even responding. She was afraid she'd sound 'bitchy' for pushing others to do their part and would have rathered completed the whole assignment by herself than to confront the team. And that's when I told her, don't. Do your work and only your work. Unless all of her team members had some emergency, a <em>real</em> one (all of them at once?), they were not making this project their priority. So let them learn their lesson. Communicate clearly and in a well-mannered way about what needed to get done and when and that's it. You're not their mom and we're all adults. I don't give a crap about being a "tattletale" because obviously at some point someone crosses a line by their complete lack of contribution and should know the consequences of those actions (or lack thereof). Of course this problem was back in high school, so I sincerely hope that the adults in the workforce aren't so absent-minded.</p>
              <p class="indent">It's this fairness that also drives my confusion when it comes stereotypical threats. Why should it matter if I'm a woman? Why should it matter if I'm asian? It shouldn't. It's not fair. Ah, here's the caveat, "life isn't fair." Well then <em>make</em> it fair. Just 'cause someone somewhere says life isn't fair doesn't mean we just give up and submit ourselves to some stupid stereotypical threat. Nothing changes overnight and certainly doesn't change without effort, so let's be in the fairness mindset <em>now</em>.</p>
              <p class="indent">Fairness is also what will get me by in DBC. The culture is all about how we work together, in pairs, in groups, and being fair is going to be what keeps or even drives my sanity. I or someone will set up the rules, who has what role, a set timeline and we stick to it. I know it won't always be perfect, but with all the craziness that we'll be dealing with, trusting that my partners will do their part and that I will do mine, will make things go much more smoothly.</p>
