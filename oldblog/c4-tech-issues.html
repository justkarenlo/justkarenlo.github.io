              <p id="date">10/11/2014 :: Phase 0 Week 4</p>
              <p class="indent">UNBELIEVABLE. In my last post, I had mistakenly typed in Week '3'(which I have now fixed) and almost believed it to be so! But crazy to think it's pretty much been a full month "at" DBC... And boy has it been a <em>fun</em> week. But anyways, I should stop <em>hashing</em> all the bad parts of this week since I just wrote my last post haha... (am I punny? .. no, not really. But, I try.)</p>
              <p id="section">News</p>
              <p class="indent">In case you didn't know, there's quite a gap between the amount of women programmers vs men programmers. Heck, I got a scholarship <strong>just for being a woman</strong>. Well, I'm glad a lot of companies are <em>beginning</em> to focus more on this issue and some recent events have also increased the awareness of the question on equal pay. Women in the tech industry are consistently dominated by the male population (also got to point out, we get paid LESS for the same position compared to males), to the point where asking for a raise or determining how much you're worth (do <em>you</em> know how much you <em>should</em> be paid when you get outta here? And how much you should be getting paid after a couple years of experience?) becomes a lot more challenging and less fair than it should be. Of course it's not just in this industry that women face this dilemma, but it is apparent the male:female ratio is so large that this issue <em>needs</em> to be addressed.</p>
              <p class="indent">In this <a style="font-style: italic; color: #98E6B8" href="http://www.salon.com/2014/10/10/microsoft_ceo_apologizes_for_tone_deaf_advice_for_women_about_raises/">article</a> you can find the video to the interview where Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, provided some an ill-advised comment about women and whether or not they should be asking for raises. The reaction to the video, followed by his public apology shows that this issue is receiving notice, but just barely. And just a few weeks ago, Emma Watson delivered a major <a style="font-style: italic; color: #98E6B8" href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/emma-watson-gender-equality-is-your-issue-too">speech</a> on gender equality and how women shouldn't be the only ones standing up for themselves, but that men should join in on this cause. And that's how we can slowly make our transition as a society and in the tech industry to show that women are worth just as much as men and we can bring just as much to the tech world.</p>
