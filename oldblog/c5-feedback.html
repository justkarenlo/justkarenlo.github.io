          <p class="minorsection">Pairing</p>
          <p class="indent">So during these last 5 weeks, we at Dev Bootcamp, have been training not only the technical aspects of Ruby and becoming a web developer, but also the social side. As some of you may know, we pair program, like they do in the <em>real world</em> and doing so has taught me a lot about people and myself.</p>
          <p class="indent">Every week so far, I have paired with approximately 3 different people. Each person I've paired with were completely different to each other, in terms of personality and technical knowledge; but overall, everyone has been kind. I can see that everyone has a genuine interest to learn <strong>and</strong> teach. We're all adults, and maybe this shouldn't be a surprise to me, but everyone is also quite mature. There is respect, there is knowledge sharing, and I dearly hope that when it comes time to pair program in the work field, that it'll be as successful as these pairing challenges (am I being too optimistic?) Overall, my experiences have been rewarding. They give me the sense that I'm not alone, that there is accountability to learn the material (not just me, but also my partner) and that we share the same goal: LEARN and finish the challenge.</p>
          <p class="indent">I think some situations that everyone is worried about is if the partner's personality is difficult or if both partners are equal in the "I have no idea how to even begin to approach this challenge" technical level. I haven't experienced the former, but I have the latter. And that pairing session was probably the longest ever (over 2 hours). But I think I learned the most about myself in that session. It's always fine and dandy when both pairs knows how to get the answer, or heck, if even one person knows and guides the other. But when both are stuck? It can get frustrating quite fast. But <em>that</em> is what's going to happen the most in real life. This is why meetings are held; when no one knows the exact solution to a problem. There wouldn't be any point of a meeting if there's no problem to begin with. Being able to keep your cool, take the initiative to ask the right questions, do your research, and collaborate. That's what makes a great pairing session.</p>
          <p class="minorsection">Feedback</p>
          <p class="indent">I guess since all of my pairings have been quite good, it has been reflected as such in my feedback. Reading the feedback others have given me from these pairings actually encourages me further to do well so that I can contribute more in the next session. It also pushes me so that I'll never want to "get lazy" (definitely want to avoid that negative review!). And providing feedback is just as important as receiving it. Whenever I review, I evaluate the things they AND I did that were great, and things that weren't so much. But whatever feedback it may be, <span style="font-style: italic; color: #98E6B8">we are constantly inspiring each other.</span> And I think that statement in itself is a beautiful thing. Being inspired by a role model who's been there and done that is great, but to feel that way toward your own classmate? Where's the competition? Where's the envy? To be honest, it's definitely still there, but it's not the driving force for us to be better. The driving force is the unity of our dream. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #F55C86">WE WANT TO BECOME THE BEST WEB DEVELOPERS WE CAN BE. AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP EACH OTHER GET THERE.</span> </p>
