              <p id="date">11/13/2014 :: Phase 0 Week 9</p>
              <p class="indent">And just like that, it's been 9 weeks and Monday begins the actual core journey at DBC. Who would have thought I would survive through these past few weeks unscathed? I was expecting some serious pain (there were some moments), but now I <em>know</em> the pain is gonna happen...maybe even starting Monday. Am I being too pestimistic? I'd like to think of myself as someone who expects the worse, so if the worse doesn't happen, it's a win! (I'll have to evaluate whether that's a healthy mentality or not...probably not)</p>
              <p class="indent">The past 9 weeks have taught me a lot. Obviously the technical, but also culturally about myself. What with all the pairing sessions we do every week and the feedback we need to provide to each other, I found myself noticing how imperative it was to be as descriptive as possible when communicating. Especially when it came to asking questions, being able to ask a good question meant the likelihood of getting the answer I was looking for.</p>
              <p class="indent">When it comes to asking a good coding question keep these in mind:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>don't make any assumptions</li>
                <li>make your question as detailed as possible, but to the point</li>
                <li>start with what language you are working on</li>
                <li>what your parameters are</li>
                <li>what your expected outputs are</li>
                <li>what error code you are given (if any)</li>
                <li>and, if possible, a sample of the code you are currently using</li>
              </ul>
                <p class="indent">With these in mind I found that the recipient to my questions understood exactly what I needed, and even on occasion, by running through this checklist I would end up solving my own question.</p>
                <p class="indent">Shielded with this knowledge, the commitment I have towards my future, the support from my friends and family, and all that DBC has taught me so far, I'm ready for my journey to start on Monday.</p>
