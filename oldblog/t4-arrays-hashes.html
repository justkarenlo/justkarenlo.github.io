  <p class="indent">
    AHHHH finally <strong>Ruby</strong> this week! It's been a nice refreshing stretch to get back into ruby groove again. I worked so hard just to make sure I did well on the interview that I spent quite a bit of time getting down the logic and coding. And this week with all the pairings, I'm proud to say I <em>actually helped</em>. Not to say I didn't carry my weight the previous weeks, 'cause I believe I did. But this week was different. I had forgotten how much I love the feeling of being dependable. Having quit my job and starting a brand new career, I've been the one depending on others for their support. I'm just grateful...others have helped me and I get to pay it back! Alright, sentimental-ness aside, let's get started on the topic of this week!
  </p>
  <p id="section">"More Know-How"</p>
  <br>
  <table style="border: 2px solid white">
    <thead colspan="2">
      <tr>
        <th colspan= "3"; style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 2px solid white">Arrays versus Hashes</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 2px solid white">Arrays</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; border-left: 2px solid white; border-bottom: 2px solid white">Hashes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>
            <pre>
  RossandRachel = ["We","were","on","a","BREAK!"]
            </pre>
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>From the example above, you can see that this iconic string would not really make sense if it were out of order. </li>
              <li>Arrays have a specific order to them and the first index begins with  <strong>0</strong>(zero)</li>
          </ul>
          <pre>
            array_name = [0,1,2,3,4]
          </pre>
          <p style="margin-left: 8px">
            So as you can see, even though an array can house 5 items, but its index only goes up to 4 because the count starts with zero rather than one.
            <br>
            Only these indexes are used to identify a specific position in an array:
          </p>
          <pre>
            RossandRachel[0]= "We"
            RossandRachel[1]= "were"
            RossandRachel[2]= "on"
            RossandRachel[3]= "a"
            RossandRachel[4]= "BREAK!"
          </pre>
          <p style="margin-left: 8px">There's so much you can do with arrays, but here's a little taste if you want to check how many items/elements are in an array:</p>
          <pre>
            RossandRachel.length
            =>  5
          </pre>
        </td>
        <td style="border-left: 2px solid white">
          <p>
  <pre>           Friends = {

  "Rachel" => "Left a man at the alter"
  "Ross" => "Married a lesbian"
  "Joey" => "Threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire"
  "Phoebe" => "Fell in love with a gay ice dancer"
  "Chandler" => "Lived in a box"
  "Monica" => "Dated her ex's son"
            }
            </pre>
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Hashes don't care about order, they act on a key-value basis, shown in the example above.</li>
              <li> The <strong>keys</strong> are the names of the main 6 characters on the show, in <em>no particular order</em>.</li>
              <li> The <strong>values</strong> that are paired with the characters are the things they've done that they aren't necessarily proud of...</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left: 8px">
            Since order doesn't matter in hashes, you'd only need to know and call a key (a name in this case if you were curious about any of the Friends vices) to pull the related content. This is a great tool to use when devising an address book (ex. key= name; value = address). Or keep a list of gift ideas for each friend or.......... even a list of all the things (money, borrowed DVDs, games, etc.) each friend owes you over the years...hmmm

          <pre>
      Friends["Ross"]
      ==> "Married a lesbian"
      Friends["Phoebe"]
      ==> "Fell in love with a gay ice dancer"
      Friends["Joey"]
      ==> "Threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire"
