              <p class="indent">Welcome back! I always save these blog challenges until last to do, as if that'll help ease some of the pain from the challenges...and trust me, this week was filled with a lot of pain (I dearly hope I was not the only one in feeling this way). Let's just say that the challenges stretched my brain in ways that I would not call "comfortable." But I did learn something. I'm going to get stuck, I'm going to be stumped, I'm going to be exhausted, I'm going to be disheartened that I don't get an answer right away... and that does NOT mean I'm failing. I'm struggling. Ha. Doesn't sound much better, but if I'm struggling, that means I care, this 'stuff' matters to me, and that means I'm not giving up. Now on to some learning! YAY. </p>
              <p id="section">"Know-How"</p>
              <p class="indent">After doing some research on <strong>.group_by</strong>,<strong>.cycle</strong>, and <strong>.map</strong>, I decided to focus on .group_by (because this was brand new to me and also...happened to think of a way to incorporate Friends). So here goes: </p>
              <p class="indent">.group_by can take a block of multiple elements, such as an array or range, and turn them into a hash based on the condition you place. Say I wanted to group the Friends characters' names by the length of the name...here's how I would use the .group_by method to accomplish this:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #CC6AB6">Input</span>: First you'll have the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#F55C86">object</span> you want your method to act on (group of names in this instance), your <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#F55C86">.group_by</span> method, and then your <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #F55C86">conditional block</span>. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #CC6AB6">Output</span>: <span style="font-style: italic; color: #14CCC8">keys</span> that correspond to the length of the name and <span style="font-style: italic; color: #14CCC8">values</span>, which are the names that have that length.</p>
              <pre style="background-color: #98E6B8; color: black; font-size: 12px">
  ["Ross","Rachel","Phoebe","Joey","Monica","Chandler"].group_by {|name| name.length}

  => {4=>["Ross", "Joey"], 6=>["Rachel", "Phoebe", "Monica"], 8=>["Chandler"]}
              </pre>
              <p class="indent">GREAT! You have just written a function that allows you to know which Friends share the same name length. Don't know why exactly you would <em>want</em> to do that, but you CAN. And being able to do something even when you don't need to is such a great freedom, ain't it? Now you know how to group_by right? Obviously you can use this method for other types of problems, play with it, manipulate it, break it..that's how we learn! I hope this post helped! I feel like learning is always a little easier when you use "real life" examples. </p>
